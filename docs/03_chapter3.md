# Linkage mapping reveals loci that underlie differences in _C. elegans_ body growth
\chaptermark{Genetics and growth}

## Preface
The Andersen lab is particularly adept at connecting phenotypic variation in a population to unique genetic variants. As a follow-up to the work described in the previous chapter, I was interested in leveraging this expertise to explore how natural genetic variation influenced growth in _C. elegans_. This meant running another 50-hour-long time course experiment (on my golden birthday no less!), digging into a treasure trove of “throw-away” data collected in 2014, and working with a few new strains other than our good pal N2. The following chapter is based off of my work on this project, submitted as a first-author manuscript to G3 in March 2022.
